<p>So, the right question should be - “Why am I blogging now?”.&nbsp;I am 38 years old,&nbsp;if I did not find the need to blog when blogging was young,&nbsp;then why now when not a lot of people prefer reading or writing. </p>

<p>Firstly, I believe I now have something to share with the world. I believe that after 10-15 years of working (struggling), speaking and working with some wonderful people, I have some insights.</p>

<p>I started writing for myself in early 2020. Now that content has become a little big and I believe it has taken a decent shape and form. I feel it is the right time that I should share it with others so that they can get help in whatever they are struggling with. </p>

<p>One might ask - “Ok, so why a blog? Why not content in a different format?” - Answer is simple, Writing is much easier than shooting a video. </p>

<p>In this Blog, I want to share whatever I have learnt about the World, Business, Life and Philosophy. </p>
