                                Imagine yourself in a job where your monthly income is Rs. 50,000. Things have been
                                going well, and you've even received a raise. You've managed to save money and invest in
                                mutual funds. Then, someone suggests that, given your success, you should buy a home by
                                taking a home loan. This way, you not only gain an asset in the form of a home, but you
                                can also enhance your affordability. You think, <i>"Yes, that's a smart way to increase
                                    my
                                    wealth."</i> So, you start looking for homes, find one worth Rs. 20 lakhs, and
                                decide to
                                take a home loan of Rs. 15 lakhs, considering you have Rs. 5 lakhs in savings. In
                                essence, you take on debt.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Debt, or credit, serves as a lever central banks employ to stimulate growth. Imagine if
                                no bank was willing to grant you a home loan, would you be in a position to buy a home?
                                The answer would likely be no. Nations, like individuals, require capital to grow and
                                expand quickly. To serve their capital needs the nations also borrow money.

                                </b><br />

                                The US National Treasury manages the nation's debt. They borrow money from the public by
                                issuing Treasury Bonds (T-bonds). Public debt is held by individual investors,
                                institutions, and foreign governments. 
                                <br /><br />
                                <b>So, why do foreign governments hold US Treasury Bonds? </b>

                                Given that much of global trade happens in US
                                dollars, foreign central banks need to maintain US dollars as part of their foreign
                                exchange reserves. You can find a list of countries that have invested in US Treasury

                                Returning to our analogy, imagine that
                                after buying a home, which is an asset, you purchase another home, a car, and an
                                iPhoneâ€”all financed by debt. Your salary has increased, and you've received promotions,
                                but your monthly expenses now amount to Rs. 200,000, even though your income is
                                Rs.125,000. Now you're in trouble. Your debt-to-income ratio is 160%, and a significant
                                portion of your expenses goes toward servicing loans, i.e paying interest on those
                                loans. This expense doesn't generate any assets. It doesn't give you a home or
                                dividends.

                                A similar issue is occurring with the US. The US has accumulated around <a

                                resulting in a debt-to-GDP ratio of approximately 122%. According to the US Treasury
                                Statement, it paid <a

                                Treasury Department) and $630 billion in fiscal year 2023 to date, which constitutes
                                around 11% of its overall expenses.

                                <b>How did the US land in this situation?</b><br/>
                                As I mentioned earlier, to ensure some level of growth, debt is essential. Every entity
                                relies on some form of debt but since the last 3-4 years, US debt has increased a lot. A
                                lot of this happened because of COVID. In response to the economic challenges posed by
                                the pandemic, the U.S. government implemented several relief measures, including
                                stimulus payments which required additional capital. The US government borrowed money 
                                by issuing more Treasury Bonds.

                                <b>But why is this problematic? Why can't the US print more dollars?</b><br/>

                                Being a global reserve currency offers significant advantages. Every nation desires the currency of your country. The US can print more dollars to service its debt, However, this approach leads to an excess of unproductive currency, as it doesn't generate goods or services. Furthermore, excessive printing of dollars can devalue the US currency and this will do a lot of damage to the creditworthiness of the US. If a country, much like an individual, cannot manage its debt, its creditworthiness declines.

                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                <b>So, why was there an outcry over the Debt Ceiling?</b><br/>

                                The US has a concept known as the Debt Ceiling, which restricts the government's borrowing to a certain limit. Once this limit is reached, the government must either default or raise the debt ceiling. Many governments have raised the debt ceiling in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling#cite_note-8" class="inline-link">past</a>. Raising the debt ceiling is more political thatn economical. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As you might guess, increasing the debt ceiling is not the right way to manage debt. As with individuals, nations should reduce the unnecessary expenses to manage and reduce debt to avoid defaults.
