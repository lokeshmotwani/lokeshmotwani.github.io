                <p>There are 2 Worlds.</p>

                <p>
                  One world that we know is made of atoms and is real. This
                  world is extremely complex, as we all know. All the rules of
                  physics, chemistry, and other sciences apply there. However,
                  there is another world that might be more complex than the
                  real world. This world resides in the human mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                  How can I even dare to say that a world is in a human mind?
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is not the world that stays in the mind, but the perception
                  of how the world is, that stays in the human mind. That
                  perception can be really complex.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Perception, which can also be called a point of view or frame
                  of mind, is formed by many things. Since we are all not equals,
                  perception can be formed by the situations we had to deal with
                  in our past, the situations we are dealing with now, our peer
                  group, our education, the state of the society in which we are
                  living, and our family. In short Perceptions are formed by our <a href="the-theory-of-advantages-and-disadvantages" class="inline-link"> advantages and the disadvantages </a>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  Every individual has their own perception of the real world.
                  You might perceive something or someone differently from how I
                  perceive it. So, there are about 8 billion different
                  perceptions of the same physical world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary" class="inline-link">Timothy Leary</a> coined a term -
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_tunnel">Reality Tunnel</a>
                </p>

                <p><i>
                  Reality tunnel is a theory that, with a subconscious set of
                  mental filters formed from beliefs and experiences, every
                  individual interprets the same world differently, hence "Truth
                  is in the eye of the beholder."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, if Truth is in the eye of the beholder, then each of us
                  has a Subjective Truth about this world, and that's why I
                  initially mentioned that Subjective truth can be way more
                  complex than the actual world. But if I also consider the
                  rules of evolution, subjective truth might actually be less
                  complex than the Objective truth, as our brains are wired to
                  conserve energy, and in order to understand the world in a
                  simplistic manner, we would have an easier map stored in our
                  minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the individual confirms to any idea
                  which aligns with his own perspective of the world and rejects
                  to any idea which does not align is called confirmation bias.
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> in his famous book <a target="_blank" class="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Selfish-Gene-Oxford-Landmark-Science/dp/0198788606/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2K59CIEEKJ0PI&amp;keywords=selfish+gene&amp;qid=1698588918&amp;sprefix=selfish+gen%252Caps%252C204&amp;sr=8-3&_encoding=UTF8&tag=motwanil-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=535de51c65c243d0d61092931c21ca89&camp=3638&creative=24630">The Selfish Gene</a> coined a
                  term - Meme. A meme is an idea, behavior or a style that
                  spreads from a person to person. A Meme is transmitted from
                  one mind to another. That is only possible when the Meme is
                  aligned with the existing perception or belief.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Individual’s Perception holds a very important role in the
                  functioning of the real world as perceptions can be shaped to
                  form a Collective Perception. That’s how societies function.
                  So religion, nations, companies are collective perception. Without our ability to
                  form collective perceptions, this world would have been a very
                  different place. I am not even sure if there would be a world also. So, leaders & marketing agencies/ use all the
                  powers to influence you to change your perception about an
                  idea or thing and form a collective perception
                </p>
                <p>
                  As businesses, our goal is to build products which perceive as highly valuable. Any commpany which does that becomes valuable. In business we call this Perceived Value. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  What's your perceived value of an iPhone?
