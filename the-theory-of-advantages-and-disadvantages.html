                  This is a theory which I came up with in 2018. Since then I
                  have been observing this again and again over time. Later,
                  these ideas got validated in various books.
                </p>

                <p><b>All of us are not born equals.</b></p>
                <p>
                  All of us have unique advantages over others. Some people
                  might have excellent genes hence they are good in logic,
                  problem solving or possess excellent physical attributes. Some
                  people get a great education as their parents were aware of
                  how important a good education is. These advantages play a big
                  role in anyone’s life. Think of advantage as your unique
                  weapon. Similarly all of us have some disadvantages. Some
                  might be prone to unhealthy habits, some might have anger
                  issues, some might be unfortunate to have some physical
                  disabilities. Some diseases are genetic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The end result of your life and starting point of your progeny
                  would be the net sum of these advantages and disadvantages.
                  Read the last sentence again.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Advantages & Disadvantages not only play a role in personal
                  life. They also play a big role in

                  >
                  games. Businesses, Armies, Nations also have advantages and
                  disadvantages. A young population was a huge advantage for
                  China. Lack of natural resources can be a big disadvantage for
                  any nation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Top businesses have a lot of advantages. They don’t mention it
                  in public but they do have some advantage which helps them
                  retain their position. Great advantages help you maintain your
                  positioning in business and war. Businesses which do not have
                  any advantage will eventually fail. Startups have advantages
                  of speed. Big businesses have advantages of brand and capital.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Great Environment is a huge advantage. Why do you think most
                  of the good physicists were in the US or why did most of the
                  inventions came from the US? The United States provides a
                  great advantage to all the aspiring scientists, entrepreneurs,
                  etc in terms of a good environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Individuals, Nations & Businesses have a little control of
                  their destinies. Most of our lives would be spent enjoying the
                  benefits of the advantages and suffering due to our
                  disadvantages. This sounds dramatic but that’s the truth.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Does that mean that we do not have anything in our control in
                  our personal lives- The answer is No.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We do have little control. First, We will have control over
                  our lives if we become mindful of our advantages and
                  disadvantages. Being mindful also comes to those who reflect
                  back and have good education. Second, we take proactive action
                  to mitigate the disadvantages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The real successful life would be the one which would reduce
                  the disadvantages it received and amplify the advantages it
                  got to increase the net sum and pass it to the next
                  generations. I also feel that carrying over advantages to the
                  next generation is evolution. The next generation do not
                  necessarily mean your own progeny. Some advantages are for the
                  greater good.
